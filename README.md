# Description of the dataset
The data set represents Covid-19 statistics including deaths, timelines, and pre-existing conditions. This dataset is instrumental for multifaceted analysis, offering insights into the evolution of the pandemic's mortality impact over time and across different segments of the population. Such data are crucial for directing healthcare strategies, prioritizing research, and mobilizing resources to protect the most vulnerable groups in the ongoing fight against the pandemic.

# Question 2 - How have the total reported Covid-19 deaths changed on a yearly basis from 2020 through 2023?
This graphs displays a detailed breakdown of Covid-19 deaths against a backdrop of various comorbid conditions, further segmented into age groups. The visualization underscores the heightened risk associated with certain pre-existing health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and paints a picture of how the virus disproportionately affected different age demographics, with older age groups showing higher mortality in conjunction with these conditions.

# Question 1 - What comorbidities are most commonly associated with Covid-19 deaths, and how does this distribution vary across different age groups?
This graph presents a comparative annual view of the fatalities due to the virus from 2020 through 2023. A clear downward trend is observable, with the highest number of deaths in 2020, which progressively decreases in the following years. This pattern could reflect various factors, including the implementation of public health measures, the development and distribution of vaccines, and the possible decrease in virulence of the virus over time.
