# Description of the dataset
The data set represents Covid-19 statistics including deaths, timelines, and pre-existing conditions. This dataset is instrumental for multifaceted analysis, offering insights into the evolution of the pandemic's mortality impact over time and across different segments of the population. Such data are crucial for directing healthcare strategies, prioritizing research, and mobilizing resources to protect the most vulnerable groups in the ongoing fight against the pandemic. The data set provides information about the leading causes of Death in the United States as well, which allows for comparison to Covid-19's impact on the U.S. death rates.

# Question 1 - How did the prevalence of certain comorbid conditions among different age groups contribute to the annual mortality trends observed in Covid-19 deaths over the period of 2020 to 2023?
Importance:
These graphs collectively provide a nuanced understanding of the mortality trends due to Covid-19 by correlating the impact of underlying health conditions with annual death counts. The first graph establishes the temporal trend of fatalities due to the virus, while the second graph delves deeper to reveal how various pre-existing health issues, coupled with age, have influenced these trends. Together, they can help public health officials understand the changing dynamics of the pandemic's toll on the population, informing both the immediate response and long-term health policy planning.

This graphs displays a detailed breakdown of Covid-19 deaths against a backdrop of various comorbid conditions, further segmented into age groups. The visualization underscores the heightened risk associated with certain pre-existing health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and paints a picture of how the virus disproportionately affected different age demographics, with older age groups showing higher mortality in conjunction with these conditions.

This graph presents a comparative annual view of the fatalities due to the virus from 2020 through 2023. A clear downward trend is observable, with the highest number of deaths in 2020, which progressively decreases in the following years. This pattern could reflect various factors, including the implementation of public health measures, the development and distribution of vaccines, and the possible decrease in virulence of the virus over time. 

# Question 2 - What are the leading causes of death in the United States, and how do these causes vary by state?
Importance: The importance of this dataset lies in its ability to inform public health initiatives and policy decisions. By understanding the primary causes of mortality, healthcare providers and policymakers can target interventions, allocate resources effectively, and create awareness campaigns tailored to specific health threats. This information is crucial for preventative measures and improving the overall health outcomes of the population.

This graph provides a clear numerical breakdown of deaths by cause, giving a quick reference to the magnitude of each cause's impact on a national scale. The simplicity of the table format allows for an immediate understanding of the hierarchy of health threats, with conditions like heart disease and cancer at the forefront.

This visualization allows for a comparative regional analysis, showing how different states may have varying health challenges. For instance, it might reveal that some states have higher rates of deaths due to certain conditions than others, which could be due to demographic, environmental, lifestyle, or healthcare access differences.

# Manipulating the data for analysis
In order to display appropriate data, the columnn had to be excluded that showed all deaths in the United States. This row had to be excluded because it was a summation of all of the individual state breakdowns. By excluding this data, it allowed for a graph that is easier to read and provides useful data. The data provided has no duplicate data, redundant data, inaccurate data, or low-quality data. The data did not have to be cleaned or filtered and contains no third party imports.

# Tableau packaged workbook
The workbook used to manipulate data has been attached to the repository.
